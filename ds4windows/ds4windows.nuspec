### Simple and Clean UI

Since the idea is to get to get your controller ready for games, The UI was made to make to be quick to pick up. Once first launched, the tool takes your through the setup, gives you a default profile and you're ready to go, or if you choose you can change things to your heart's content.

### Profile System

With profiles, it makes it easier to quickly swap through various settings for your controller. You can set up controls for certain games, or set the lightbar to your favorite color. You can even swipe two fingers along the touchpad to swap profiles without the need to even open back the program.

### Automatic Profiles

Along with switching profiles manually, you can also switch your controllers to different profiles automatically when certain programs are launched.

### Tons of options

From control mapping, to touchpad sensitivity, to marcos, to rainbow lightbar, to motion controls, to special actions triggerd by pressing multiple actions, to launching a program with profiles, there are plenty of settings to play around with.
