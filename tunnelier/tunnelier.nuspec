    <releaseNotes>Changes in Bitvise SSH Client 4.60:    [ 4 February 2013 ]

The xterm/vt100 terminal client has been re-implemented to improve performance and add new features.
Default colors displayed by the xterm/vt100 terminal client can now be configured on the Terminal tab.
Command-line clients (sftpc, stermc, sexec) now support a parameter to enable delegation when using Kerberos user authentication with standard SSH host authentication and key exchange. Previously, the command line clients supported delegation only when using Kerberos-based key exchange.
The Host Key Manager can now store multiple host key fingerprints per SSH host. When a new host key is verified by the user, it is now added to other known keys for that host, instead of replacing them.
To improve compatibility with some FTP clients, FTP-to-SFTP bridge will now send more conventional reply codes to USER and PASS commands, mimicking the behavior of FTP servers that require authentication.
When launched from the Bitvise SSH Client graphical client, the terminal client now supports executing a custom command (as an exec request) instead of requesting a plain shell.
When using single-click Remote Desktop forwarding, temporary RDP profiles are now removed from the "most recently opened" list for the Remote Desktop Connection shortcut.
WoW64 filesystem redirection is now disabled when creating temporary RDP profiles for single-click Remote Desktop forwarding.
Improved keyboard accessibility for launch bar icons in the graphical client.
Changes in Bitvise SSH Client 4.51:    [ 20 October 2012 ]

Command line clients: Improved text colors; added a color scheme for dark blue background, and a color scheme for PowerShell's default colors and palette.
Remote Desktop: Fixed an issue which could cause the SSH client to not detect the Remote Desktop client version on 64-bit platforms.
Tunneling: Implemented a workaround for the Dropbear server, which translates the client's request to listen on 127.0.0.1 into "localhost" in server-to-client forwarding.</releaseNotes>
